# Important info

This fork was linked in the ntscQT readme, which means it'll probably get some attention now.

This isn't intended as a replacement for, or an enhanced version of, ntscQT. I created it solely so that I could make pull requests against the original ntscQT repository.

You're probably looking for:
- ### [ntsc-rs](https://github.com/valadaptive/ntsc-rs), my Rust rewrite of ntscQT that is fast enough to run in real time, and can be used as a standalone application, After Effects plugin, or OpenFX plugin.
- ### [ntscQT+](https://github.com/rgm89git/ntscQTplus), an ntscQT fork that *is* intended to be its own project, and includes the code cleanups and enhancements that I've made in this repository.
- [This repository's `cleanups` branch](https://github.com/valadaptive/ntscqt/tree/cleanups), which is just the original ntscQT with *only* my code cleanups and enhancements. Note that I will not be providing any support for it.
